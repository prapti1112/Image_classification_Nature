Task 1:
Could you please explain how you would go about building a classification model using the dataset provided in this 
link: https://storage.googleapis.com/wandb_datasets/nature_12K.zip'? 
What steps would you take to train and test the model?
Answer:
I would use the following steps to build a classification model:
1. Analyse the dataset
     (i) Is data balanced or not? The data set used here is balanced
    (ii) Is data augmentation need? [In this case I have decided to not perform data augmentation]
2. Build the structure of loading data and other utilities [This includes using tensorflow dataset to preprocess and build dataset for training]
3. Building the actual model architecture according to the official paper. Here the architectures used are:
     (i) VGG19
    (ii) ResNet152
    From all these architectures the one performing the best is choosen for further tuning
4. Apply hyperparameter tuning on the model to get best accuracy


Task 2:
Once you have built the initial model, how would you approach tuning its hyperparameters? Could you explain how you would log the hyperparameters and 
evaluate their impact on improving the model's accuracy?

Task 3:
In the scenario where the model is not performing well, what steps would you take to conduct a detailed analysis of the failure? How would you go about 
debugging the neural network to identify potential issues?

Task 4:
After completing the above tasks, what additional steps would you take to further improve the model's accuracy? Could you outline your proposed approach 
and explain the reasoning behind it?
